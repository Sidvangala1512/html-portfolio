<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Siddharth! I'm 17 years old and recently completed my 12th grade from Reso Vizag. I've always had a passion for coding, and my journey into the world of web development started with a keen interest in creating and building things on the web.

  Currently, I'm diving deep into a web development course, where I've completed the HTML section and am now working towards mastering CSS, JavaScript, and backend web development. My goal is to continue expanding my skills, learning new technologies, and eventually build full-stack web applications.
  
  I'm always excited to challenge myself and push the boundaries of my knowledge. Stay tuned as I continue this journey and share my progress along the way!</p>
