<h1>Some of the best movies according to Siddharth</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dead poets society</h3>
<p>I had watched this movie once before, a while ago, with my folks — but back then, I was too young to truly grasp what it was trying to convey. A couple of days ago, bored out of my mind, I decided to rewatch Dead Poets Society. And this time, it hit differently.

    The screenplay, the acting, and the story were all on point. The film beautifully portrayed the profound impact a passionate teacher can have on a student’s life. It also captured the raw, often overlooked beauty of poetry — not just as an art form, but as a way of thinking, feeling, and living.

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I don’t believe anyone can watch this movie in a theatre without their jaw dropping in pure awe. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking — every frame feels like a glimpse into the vastness of the universe. This film played a profound role in deepening my fascination with cosmology, making the mysteries of space feel both grand and personal. And let’s not forget the cast — their performances were spot-on, bringing depth and emotion to every scene.

<h3>A Minecraft movie</h3>
<p>
    This movie revolves around the game Minecraft. Although it's primarily aimed at kids, I found it genuinely entertaining. It highlighted how, in the real world, creativity is often overlooked or discouraged — but in Minecraft, you're free to build, explore, and create without limits. The game never feels like a chore; instead, it celebrates imagination. Watching this movie made me want to fire up the game all over again.
